A mock Decision Support System (DSS) simulating registrations at a Travel Agency managing numerous customers and destinationsfor travel. The application picks out destinations from an SQLite database and presents options through a user interface programmed using elements from JAVA Swing.

A fully functional .jar is provided (Travel.jar) along with a mocked SQLite database (TravelAgency). Both files (.jar + database) should be placed in the same directory to properly run the program.
